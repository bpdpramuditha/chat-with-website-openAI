Ask AT Digital – Chatbot with OpenAI + LangChain + Streamlit
This project is a chatbot application built with Streamlit, LangChain, HuggingFace embeddings, and OpenAI GPT models. It allows users to ask questions about AT Digital’s website, and the chatbot answers using both:
• The website dataset (website_data.json)
• Its own knowledge (via GPT) if context is missing

---

Features
• Uses LangChain to handle embeddings, retrieval, and conversational memory.
• HuggingFace Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for text embeddings.
• ChromaDB as the vector store for efficient semantic search.
• Custom PromptTemplate ensures the bot always tries to help.
• OpenAI GPT model (gpt-4o-mini) for generating responses.
• Interactive Streamlit UI with chat history.
• Environment variables handled with .env (secure API key storage).

Installation

1. Clone the repository
   https://github.com/bpdpramuditha/chat-with-website-openAI.git
   cd ask-at-digital

2. Create a virtual environment
   Using conda (recommended):
   • conda create -n ask-at-digital python=3.10 -y conda
   • activate ask-at-digital

   Or using venv:
   • python -m venv venv  
   • venv\Scripts\activate # Windows

3. Install dependencies

   pip install streamlit langchain langchain-community langchain-core openai chromadb sentence-transformers python-dotenv

4. Creating API_KEY
   • Go to https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys
   • Sign In using a gmail
   • Click create new secret key
   • Give a Name
   • Select project as default
   • Click create api key
   • Copy the generated API Key

5. Setup environment variables
   • Create a .env file in the project root:
   • OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   Replace your_openai_api_key_here with your actual key from OpenAI.

Dataset Format
The app uses a JSON dataset (src/website_data.json) with the following structure:
[{"page": "Home", "url": "https://atdigital.io/", "text": "AT Digital provides web development, AI solutions, and digital marketing services to help businesses grow online."},
{ "page": "About Us", "url": "https://atdigital.io/about", "text": "We are a team of developers, designers, and AI specialists committed to delivering innovative digital solutions."},

Running the App
Run Streamlit:
streamlit run src/app.py

---

How It Works 1. Load Data
• Reads website_data.json
• Splits content into chunks (500 chars with 50 overlap)
• Embeds chunks with HuggingFace MiniLM model
• Stores in Chroma vector database 2. Conversational Chain
• Uses ConversationalRetrievalChain with OpenAI GPT (gpt-4o-mini)
• Retrieves relevant chunks from vector DB
• Injects context + chat history into a custom prompt 3. User Interaction
• User inputs a question via st.chat_input()
• Chat history is maintained (HumanMessage, AIMessage)
• Responses are displayed in a clean chat format
